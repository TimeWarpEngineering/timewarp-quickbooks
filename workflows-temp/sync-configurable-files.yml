            ## Summary
            This PR automatically syncs configurable files from the parent TimeWarp Architecture repository to maintain consistency with organizational standards.

            ### Files Synced
            - Configuration files for .NET development
            - Common development tools configuration
            - Standard ignore patterns (merged with local additions)

            ### Review Notes
            - This is an automated sync from `TimeWarpEngineering/timewarp-architecture`
            - Local customizations in synced files may have been preserved or updated
            - Please review changes before merging

            ## Test Plan
            - [ ] Verify build still works after sync
            - [ ] Check that local customizations are preserved
            - [ ] Ensure no sensitive information was inadvertently synced

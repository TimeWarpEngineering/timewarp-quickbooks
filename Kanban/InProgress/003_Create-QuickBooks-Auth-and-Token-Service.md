# Task 003: Build QuickBooks Authentication and Token Management Service

## Description

In the TimeWarp.QuickBooks library add QuickBooks Authentication and Token Management service using the IppDotNetSdkForQuickBooksApiV3 NuGet package. This service will handle OAuth authentication with QuickBooks, manage access tokens, refresh tokens, and provide a secure interface for other components to interact with QuickBooks API.

## Requirements

- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for QuickBooks
- Securely store and manage access tokens and refresh tokens
- Handle token expiration and automatic refresh
- Provide a clean API for other services to use when interacting with QuickBooks
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow best practices for security when handling authentication credentials

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Create service architecture design
- [ ] Define interfaces for the authentication and token management service
- [ ] Plan token storage strategy

### Implementation
- [x] Add IppDotNetSdkForQuickBooksApiV3 NuGet package dependency
- [ ] Implement OAuth authentication flow
- [ ] Create token storage and retrieval mechanism
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic
- [ ] Create service interfaces for other components to use
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging

### Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Test token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### Documentation
- [ ] Document authentication flow
- [ ] Document service API usage
- [ ] Add configuration instructions

### Review
- [ ] Consider Security Implications of token storage
- [ ] Review error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Code Review

## Notes

The IppDotNetSdkForQuickBooksApiV3 NuGet package provides the foundation for interacting with QuickBooks API. This task focuses on building a service layer that handles authentication and token management, which will be used by other components that need to interact with QuickBooks.

Key considerations:
- OAuth 2.0 flow requires user consent, so the service should handle redirects and callbacks
- Tokens have limited lifetimes and need to be refreshed
- Secure storage of tokens is critical
- The service should be designed to be reusable across different parts of the application
- For the spike phase, token persistence will use file storage
- In the future, persistence will be migrated to Entity Framework and PostgreSQL

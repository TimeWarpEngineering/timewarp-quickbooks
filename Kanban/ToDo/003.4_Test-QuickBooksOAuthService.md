# Task 003.4: Test QuickBooksOAuthService

## Description

Create comprehensive unit tests for the QuickBooksOAuthService implementation. This task focuses on testing the OAuth service in isolation to ensure it functions correctly before integration into the sample application.

## Parent
003_Create-QuickBooks-Auth-and-Token-Service

## Requirements

- Create unit tests for all methods in the QuickBooksOAuthService
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests
- Ensure test coverage for error handling
- Follow TDD principles where appropriate

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Design test approach for OAuth service
- [ ] Create test fixtures and mocks

### Implementation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for authorization URL generation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for callback handling
- [ ] Implement unit tests for error scenarios
- [ ] Verify test coverage

### Review
- [ ] Review test quality and coverage
- [ ] Ensure all edge cases are covered

## Notes

Testing OAuth flows can be challenging due to their interactive nature. For unit tests, dependencies should be mocked to isolate the service being tested.

Key considerations:
- Mock external dependencies for unit tests
- Test both success and error paths
- Verify proper error handling
- Consider using a test framework that supports async testing
- Follow the project's existing testing conventions

## Implementation Notes

This task is dependent on the completion of Task 003.2 which implements the QuickBooksOAuthService. The tests created in this task will be used to verify the functionality of the service before it's used in the sample application created in Task 003.3.

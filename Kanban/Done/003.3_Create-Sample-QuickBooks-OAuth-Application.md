# Task 003.3: Create Sample QuickBooks OAuth Application

## Description

Create a sample application that demonstrates the usage of the QuickBooksOAuthService. This application will serve as both a testing ground and a reference implementation for the OAuth flow with QuickBooks.

## Parent
003_Create-QuickBooks-Auth-and-Token-Service

## Requirements

- Create a simple web application that uses the QuickBooksOAuthService
- Implement the full OAuth flow including authorization and callback handling
- Provide a clean UI for initiating the OAuth process and displaying results
- Include proper error handling and user feedback
- Document the sample application usage

## Checklist

### Design
- [ ] Design the application architecture
- [ ] Plan the user interface flow
- [ ] Define the integration points with QuickBooksOAuthService

### Implementation
- [ ] Create a new web application project
- [ ] Add references to the TimeWarp.QuickBooks library
- [ ] Implement controllers/pages for initiating OAuth
- [ ] Implement callback handling
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Configure the application for QuickBooks API access

### Testing
- [ ] Test the OAuth flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Verify proper user feedback

### Documentation
- [ ] Document the application setup process
- [ ] Create usage instructions
- [ ] Add comments explaining key integration points

## Notes

This sample application will serve multiple purposes:
1. Demonstrate the proper usage of the QuickBooksOAuthService
2. Provide a testing ground for the OAuth flow
3. Serve as a reference implementation for other applications
4. Help identify any issues or improvements needed in the service

The application should be simple but complete, focusing on the OAuth flow rather than additional features. Consider using ASP.NET Core for the web application.

## Implementation Notes

This task is dependent on the completion of Task 003.2 which implements the QuickBooksOAuthService.

# Task 003.1: Define IQuickBooksOAuthService Interface

## Description

Define the IQuickBooksOAuthService interface that will handle the OAuth authentication flow for QuickBooks. This interface will be part of the TimeWarp.QuickBooks library and will provide a clean API for authenticating with QuickBooks.

## Parent
003_Create-QuickBooks-Auth-and-Token-Service

## Requirements

- Define a clean, well-documented interface for OAuth authentication with QuickBooks
- Include methods for initiating the OAuth flow, handling callbacks, and retrieving tokens
- Follow best practices for interface design
- Ensure the interface is testable

## Checklist

### Design
- [x] Research QuickBooks OAuth 2.0 flow requirements
- [x] Define interface methods and properties
- [x] Document interface with XML comments

### Implementation
- [x] Create interface file in appropriate namespace
- [x] Add proper XML documentation

### Testing
- [x] Plan test approach for implementations of this interface

## Notes

The IQuickBooksOAuthService interface should be designed with the following considerations:
- OAuth 2.0 flow requires user consent, so the interface should include methods for generating authorization URLs and handling callbacks
- The interface should be independent of token storage concerns
- Methods should be async where appropriate
- The interface should be designed to be easily mockable for testing

## Implementation Notes

This task focuses only on defining the interface, not implementing it. Implementation will be handled in a separate task.

## Notes

Good documentation is essential for the adoption and proper use of the QuickBooksOAuthService. The documentation should be clear, concise, and provide enough information for developers to use the service effectively without having to understand its internal implementation details.

Key considerations:
- Use clear and concise language
- Provide code examples for common scenarios
- Explain the OAuth flow in a way that's easy to understand
- Include diagrams where appropriate
- Document security considerations and best practices
- Ensure documentation is kept up-to-date with the code

## Implementation Notes

This task is dependent on the completion of Task 003.2 which implements the QuickBooksOAuthService. The documentation should reflect the actual implementation and be updated if the implementation changes.
